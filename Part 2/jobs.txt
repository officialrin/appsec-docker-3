PART 2: Applying Migrations

1. django-migrations-job.yaml
2. django-seed-job.yaml

Two yaml files were created, one for migration, called migration.yaml, and one for seeding, called seeding.yaml using the Docker images nyuappsec/assign3:v0 and nyuappsec/assign3-db:v0.

For the database migration, Django's migrate commands can be used to make a Kubernetes job in the migrations.yaml file. 
The manage.py file can be referenced in the command portion of the file to trigger the job.
Additionally, the secrets.yaml file can be referenced.
The apply command can be used in kubectl to begin the migration.

For the seeding, an argument must be passed containing the username, password, and SQL job file in order to seed successfully.
After this is done, the Dockerfile and setup.sql must be edited and portions commented out in order for the records not to be duplicated.
In the Dockerfile, the RUN and a COPY commands must be commented out.
In the setup.sql file, the LOAD DATA INFILE commands must be commented out.
These are then re-added into the seeding.sql file.
