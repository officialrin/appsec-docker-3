PART 3: Monitoring with Prometheus

1. views.py
2. prometheus.yaml

To fix unsafe monitoring, the first part of the registering section containing the password counter monitoring "pword" variable was commented out.
To expand reasonable monitoring, in the same views.py file, a 404 error counter was added in the prometheus section.
Additionally, in instances of an ERROR return, the line graphs["404_counter"].inc() was added for the counter capability to iterate the counter.

Helm and Prometheus must be installed for the 3.3 section.
After the installation, kubectl commands can be used for setup.
In the yaml file, proxy-service:8080 should be added after target localhost:9090 to connect the file with the giftcard site.
The kubectl port-forward command can be used to deploy the server.
