1. ./GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml
2. ./db/k8/db-deployment.yaml
3. ./GiftcardSite/GiftcardSite/settings.py

To protect the secrets, I removed the secrets from each of the three files and used the django-admin-pass-secret.yaml file as a separate file for storing the secrets. In this file, I changed the name variable and added the SECRET_KEY value from settings.py in base64. To further protect the secret key in settings.py, the SECRET_KEY variable was commented out. The db-deployment and django-deploy yaml files were then edited to conceal the secrets and reference the secrets.yaml file instead. Finally, kubectl should be used to confirm the secrets and the pods must be deleted to refresh the settings.
