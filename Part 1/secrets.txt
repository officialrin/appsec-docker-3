1. ./GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml
2. ./db/k8/db-deployment.yaml
3. ./GiftcardSite/GiftcardSite/settings.py

To protect the secrets, I removed the secrets from each of the three files and used the django-admin-pass-secret.yaml file as a separate file for storing the secrets. 
In this file, I changed the name variable and added the SECRET_KEY value from settings.py in base64. 
The db-deployment.yaml and django-deploy.yaml files were then edited to conceal the secrets and reference the secrets.yaml file instead. 
The secret key in settings.py, the SECRET_KEY variable was commented out. 
Finally, kubectl should be used to apply the changes and confirm the secrets.
Finally, the pods must be deleted to refresh the settings.
