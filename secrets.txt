PART 1: Securing Secrets

1. ./GiftcardSite/k8/django-deploy.yaml
2. ./db/k8/db-deployment.yaml
3. ./GiftcardSite/GiftcardSite/settings.py

To protect the secrets, I removed the secrets from each of the three files and used the django-admin-pass-secret.yaml file as a separate file for storing the secrets. 
In this file, I changed the name variable and added the SECRET_KEY value from settings.py in base64. 
The db-deployment.yaml and django-deploy.yaml files were then edited to conceal the secrets and reference the secrets.yaml file instead. 
In settings.py, the SECRET_KEY variable was changed to os.envion.get(‘SECRET_KEY’) and the secret key that was written was commented out. 
Finally, kubectl should be used to apply the changes and confirm the secrets.
Finally, the pods must be deleted to refresh the settings.
